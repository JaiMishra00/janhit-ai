## ANSWER

## MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)

(a)  to  (c):  The  Preamble to the  statute  reads as, "An Act to establish  a mechanism to receive complaints relating to disclosure on any allegation of corruption or wilful misuse of power or wilful misuse of discretion against any public servant and to  inquire or cause an inquiry into such disclosure and to provide adequate safeguards against victimisation of the person making such complaint and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto."

The  Whistle  Blowers  Protection  Bill,  2011  was  debated/passed  by  the  Lok  Sabha  on 27.12.2011 and by the Rajya Sabha on 21.02.2014. It received the assent of the President on the 09.05.2014. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014 (No.17 of 2014) was published in the Gazette of India on 12th May 2014. In terms of the provisions under sub-section (3) of section 1 of  the  Act,  the  provisions  of  the  Act  shall  come  into  force  on  such  date  as  the  Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. No such notification has been made  by  the  Government  for  the  reason  that the  Act  requires  amendments  aimed  at safeguarding  against  disclosures  affecting  sovereignty  and  integrity  of  India,  security  of  the State,  etc.,  before  it  is  brought  into  force.  To  make  these  amendments  to  the  Act,  the Government  introduced  the  Whistle  Blowers  Protection  (Amendment)  Bill,  2015  in  the  Lok Sabha  on  11th  May  2015  which  was  passed  by  the  Lok  Sabha  on  13th  May  2015  and transmitted to the Rajya Sabha. The Bill has since lapsed upon the dissolution of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha.

(d): The Whistle Blowers' Protection mechanism presently exists in the form of Public Interest Disclosure  and  Protection  of  Informers  (PIDPI)  Resolution,  2004  dated  21.04.2004  and  the Central Vigilance Commission has been designated by the Central Government as the Agency to act on complaints from the 'whistleblowers'. The Commission has been entrusted with the responsibility of keeping the identity of the complainant confidential.
