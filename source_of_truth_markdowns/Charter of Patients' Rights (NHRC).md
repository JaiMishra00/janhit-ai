## Preamble

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) emphasizes the fundamental dignity and equality of all human beings. Based on this concept, the notion of Patient Rights has been developed across the globe in the last few decades. There is a growing consensus at international level that all patients must enjoy certain basic rights. In other words, the patient is entitled to certain amount of protection to be ensured by physicians, healthcare providers and the State, which have been codified in various societies and countries in the form of Charters of Patient's Rights. In India, there are various legal provisions related to Patient's Rights which are scattered across different legal documents e.g. The Constitution of India, Article 21, Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations 2002; The Consumer Protection Act 1986; Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940, Clinical Establishment Act 2010 and rules and standards framed therein; various judgments given by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and decisions of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

This Charter of Patient's Rights adopted by the National Human Rights Commission draws upon all relevant provisions, inspired by international charters and guided by national level provisions, with the objective of consolidating these into a single document, thereby making them publicly known in a coherent manner. There is an expectation that this document will act as a guidance document  for the Union Government and State Governments to formulate concrete mechanisms so that Patient's Rights are given adequate protection and operational mechanisms are set up

## Charter of Patients' Rights for adoption by NHRC

## Patients' rights are Human rights!

to make these rights functional and enforceable by law. This is especially important and an urgent need at the present  juncture because India does  not  have  a  dedicated  regulator  like  other  countries  and  the  existing  regulations  in  the  interest  of  patients,  governing  the  healthcare delivery system  is on the anvil, some States have adopted the national Clinical Establishments Act 2010, certain other States have enacted their own State level legislations like the Nursing Homes Act to regulate hospitals, while a few other States are in the process of adopting / developing such regulation. The Charter of Patient's Rights has been drafted with the hope that it shall be incorporated by policy makers in all existing and emerging regulatory legislations concerning the health care sector. This charter would also enable various kinds of  health care providers to actively engage with this framework of patients' rights to ensure their observance, while also benefiting from the formal codification of patients responsibilities.

Another objective of this Charter is to generate widespread public awareness and educate citizens regarding what they should expect from their governments and health care providers-about the kind of treatment they deserve as patients and human beings, in health care settings. NHRC firmly believes that informed and aware citizens can play a vital role in elevating the standard of health care, when they have guidance provided by codified rights, as well as awareness of their responsibilities.

NHRC believes that this Charter of Patients' Rights will be an enabling document to ensure the protection and promotion of Human rights of those who are among some of the most vulnerable sections of society - ordinary patients and citizens seeking health care across India.

## Recommended mechanism for implementation of Charter of Patient's Rights and Grievance redressal mechanism

NHRC recommends to the Government of India, all State Governments and Administration of all the Union Territories that they should seriously consider the adoption of  the charter and incorporate this Charter of Patients' Rights in the entire range of existing and emerging regulatory frameworks concerning the health care sector, under their jurisdiction. Further NHRC recommends that all State Human Rights Commissions should adopt the Charter of Patients' Rights to be treated as a reference document in all cases related to human rights violations concerning patients and all users of health care services.

NHRC further recommends that all administrative and regulatory authorities completely or partially related with the healthcare sector, including but  not  limited  to  the  following  should  incorporate  and  promote  implementation  of  the  Charter  of  Patient's  Rights  within  their  jurisdiction wherever applicable.

1. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India
2. Public Health and Family Welfare Departments in all States and UTs
3. Medical Education Department of States and UTs, wherever they exist
4. Executive/Managing authorities of all publicly funded healthcare insurance schemes and Public-Private-Partnership arrangements in healthcare by Government of India, all State Governments and administrations in all UTs
5. National Council for Clinical Establishments
6. State Councils for Clinical Establishments, wherever applicable

7. Authorities established under State Nursing Home Acts or equivalent acts, wherever applicable
8. Medical Council of India / National Medical Commission or equivalent body
9. State Medical Councils in all States and UTs
10. Central Council of Indian Medicine
11. State Councils for Indian Medicine in all States and UTs
12. Any other healthcare related statutory councils established in all States and UTs
13. Central Consumer Protection Council, all State and District consumer protection councils
14. Registrar of Societies in all States and UTs, in the context of non-profit clinical establishments
15. Charity Commissioner in those States wherever applicable, in the context of non-profit clinical establishments
16. Department  of  Religious  and  Charitable  Endowments  in  those  States  wherever  applicable,  in  the  context  of  non-profit  clinical establishments
17. Registrar  of  Companies,  in  the  context  of  for-profit  hospitals  run  by  companies  and  non-profit  clinical  establishments  run  by companies registered under Section 25
18. Central Drugs and Standard Control Organisation, Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of India

19. Quality Council of India, New Delhi
20. Department of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food &amp; Public Distribution, Government of India

Once the Patients'  Rights Charter  has  been  adopted  by  the  Govt.  of  India,  State  Governments  and  the  Administration  of  the  Union Territories,  they  may  stipulate/ensure  that  all  types  of  Clinical  Establishments  (both  therapeutic  and  diagnostic)  display  this  Charter prominently within  their  premises,  orient  all  their  staff  and  consultants  regarding  the  Charter,  and  observe  the  Charter  of  Patients' Rights in letter and spirit irrespective of whether such clinical establishment is owned, controlled  or managed by-

- i. the Government or a department of the Government;
- ii. a trust, whether public or private;
- iii. a  corporation  (including  a  society)  registered  under  a  Central,  Provincial  or  State  Act,  whether  or  not  owned  by  the Government;
- iv. a privately owned enterprise;
- v. a local authority

Further, NHRC recommends to the Government of India, all State Governments and administration of Union Territories to ensure the setting up of a grievance redressal mechanism for patients, as a component of their existing or emerging regulatory frameworks for clinical establishments, by  making  required  modifications  in  rules,  regulations  and  acts  where  required.  Observance  of  patients'  rights  and  setting  up  of  grievance

redressal mechanism for protection of these Rights should be made an integral component of the  implementation of Clinical Establishment (Registration  and  Regulation)  Act  2010  in  those  states  who  have  adopted  it, or  as  a  component  of  state  specific  regulatory  frameworks  for clinical  establishments in other states, which have equivalent state specific legislations, or are planning to enact state specific legislations to regulate clinical establishments.

## NHRC recommends that Patients' rights grievance redressal mechanisms should have the following components-

1. Every  clinical  establishment  should  set  up  an  internal  grievance  redressal  mechanism.  First,  patients  may  file  a  complaint  with  an authorized representative who can be named 'Internal Grievance Redressal Officer' of the clinical establishment, either individually in person  through  an  authorized  representative  or  collectively  through  a  consumer  group  or  civil  society  organization.  The  clinical establishment's Internal Grievance Redressal Officer shall consider the complaint and try to find an appropriate solution, keeping in view the provisions of the Patients' Rights Charter and promptly acknowledge the receipt of the complaint within 24 hours by assigning a registration number for tracking and tracing the status of the complaint.
2. If  a  solution  acceptable  to  the  patient  is  not  found  at  the  level  of  the  clinical  establishment  and  the  patient/representative  is  not satisfied, then he/she may approach the office of the district level registering authority set up under Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act 2010 in those States who have adopted it, or equivalent district level authorities created under the State specific clinical establishments act or similar regulatory frameworks for clinical establishments in other states which have other State specific legislations.  The  district  level  registering  authority  shall  verify  the  facts  of  the  matter,  and  where  there is  clear  violation  of  patient's

rights as brought out facts, the registering authority may issue necessary executive orders to the clinical establishment for rectification. If  there  is  any  dispute  over  interpretation  of  Charter  of  Patient's  Rights  and  provisions  in  the  regulatory  framework,  the  registering authority may clarify the procedure, rules, regulations and attempt to resolve the complaint through mediation between both parties within 30 days from the date of receipt of the appeal.

3. In case of any particular complaint, if even after completing the above mentioned procedure, the patient or his/her representative is not satisfied, then he/she can file appeal before the State Council of Clinical Establishments under Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act 2010 in those states who have adopted the Act. Section 8(5)(e) empowers the 'State Council for Clinical Establishments' to hear appeals against the orders of the District Registering Authority set up under CEA 2010. 'State Council of Clinical Establishment' can  set  up  a  three  or  five  member  sub-committee  /  cell  (with  multi-stakeholder  participation)  which  can  be  named  as  'Healthcare Grievance  Redressal  Authority'  for  resolution  of  patient's  grievances,  and  pass  rectification  orders  or  disciplinary  orders  or  punitive orders which would be binding upon the clinical establishments within the framework of CEA within 30 days from the date of receipt of the appeal. The complaints procedure to be set up under the State Council of Clinical Establishments should explicitly state that it is not intended as a means of achieving monetary compensation.
4. Apart from the above mentioned grievance redressal mechanisms, patients/representatives would always be free to approach the State Medical Council to seek disciplinary action against unethical conduct of any specific doctor, and also free to approach Consumer Forums at

various levels to seek financial compensation, or approach Civil/Criminal Courts keeping in view the nature of the complaint i.e., creation of a  separate  grievance  redressal  machinery  to  deal  with  violations  of  Patients'  Rights  Charter  shall  in  no  way  either  extinguish  or  affect adversely the existing legal remedies both civil and criminal available to patients and their caregivers under the existing legal framework.
